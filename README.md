# Freddy Bot

An open source Discord bot I made to play music for my friends since all the other ones were taken down by Google.

- To access the bots help menu, use `/help` or mention the bot in a text channel.
- [Invite The Bot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=914454054808211476&permissions=414476271168&scope=bot%20applications.commands)
- [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/Wo2BMjwA/freddybot)

## Features:
- Plays any song of your choice, as long as it's on YouTube!
- YouTube searching enabled, no need to lookup URLs!
- YouTube/Spotify playlist support for quickly adding your favorite songs to the queue!
- Discord slash command support making it easy to control your music!
- Queue up to 500 songs for you and your friends to listen to!

## Getting Started
- Join a voice channel. Make sure the bot has permission to connect to the channel you join!
- Use `/play [query]` in a channel if your choice. The query can be a search term, a YouTube link, YouTube playlist link, or a Spotify playlist link.
  - Please note: The text channel where you put the first play command will become the text channel associated with your listening session. This means the bot will send updates and notifications about song playback to that channel. In order to change this, you must start a new listening session (have the bot leave and join back). In order for the bot to work, it must have permission to send messages in that text channel.
  - If you want to restrict commands to certain roles or channels, go to `Server Settings` > `Integrations` > `Freddy Fazbear` > `Manage`.
- That's it! The bot is playing music. There are several other commands for altering your playback experience, use `/help` to view them all.

## Additional Information
- The queue has a hard limit of 500. I may raise this later on but for now it is 500.
- I am limiting my hosted version of the bot (the one with the invite link here) to 100 servers. This is being done to avoid having to verify the bot with Discord, and to avoid a cease & desist from Google.
- I will be posting and linking self-hosting instructions as soon as the process is easy enough to do so.
- If you have any questions or need to reach out to me, please fill out the contact form on [my website](https://jordantucker.dev/#contact), email the email listed on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/driedsponge), or add me on Discord `@driedsponge`.
